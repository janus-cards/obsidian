### Summary ‚åõ:

Example of [[Fully Convolutional Networks]]

Similiar to [[SegNet]] except:
- good for medical image segmentation
- the entire

### Architecture
**Contraction path** [[VGG]]
-   Consecutive of **two times of 3√ó3 Conv** and **2√ó2 max pooling** is done. This can help to extract more advanced features but it also reduce the size of feature maps.

**Expansion path**
-   Consecutive of **2√ó2 Up-conv** and **two times of 3√ó3 Conv** is done to recover the size of segmentation map. However, the above process **reduces the ‚Äúwhere‚Äù** though it **increases the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù**. That means, we can get advanced features, but we also loss the localization information. ( #Q ) ^2a4db4
-   Thus, after each up-conv, we also have **concatenation of feature maps (gray arrows) that are with the same level**. This helps to **give the localization information from contraction path to expansion path**.
-   At the end, **1√ó1 conv** to map the feature map size from 64 to 2 since the output feature map only have 2 classes, cell and membrane.

### Other consideration
**Overlap Tiles**
- With a very large image, you will want to iteratively run the CNN over parts (**Tiles**), and then stich things together.

**Elastic Deformation for Data Augmentation**

**Seperation of Touching Objects**
- This effectively allows us to to [[üå≥ Forest/100 STEM MOC/110 Computer Science MOC/Computer Vision MOC/Instance Segmentation]].
