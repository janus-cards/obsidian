### Summary ⌛:
Masked Region based CNN
A model for [[🌳 Forest/100 STEM MOC/110 Computer Science MOC/Computer Vision MOC/Instance Segmentation]]

### Motivation
- To solve the [[🌳 Forest/100 STEM MOC/110 Computer Science MOC/Computer Vision MOC/Object Detection]] problem, we could use [[Faster R-CNN]]
- To solve the [[Semantic Segmentation]] problem, we could use a [[Fully Convolutional Networks]] like [[SegNet]]

After detecting regions of interest (instance!), use FCN to get semantic segmentation.
