### Summary ⌛:
Source based routing (not the sending host but the Label Edge Router that determines the path)

Traffic engineered, using a policy for **Quality of Service** etc, and the path can be achieved by selected a FEC (and pairs of ingress-egress LER) and choosing the appropriate labels to guide traffic down a certain path so as to give **Differentiated Services** 

Signaling achieved by protocols like [[RSVP]] that communicate what the path should be by sending messages along that path. Very similar to [[Virtual Circuits]]
