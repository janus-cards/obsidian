### Summary ⌛:
A collection of physical networks connected by IP that have a single, unified administrative routing policy. The strategy for routing is determined by a single body.

### Examples
- Campus networks - although they probably statically connect to ISP and hence do not need an AS Number as no one really want to route THROUGH them - Probably a [[Stub AS]] - no [[Transit Traffic]] and gets service from only one AS above
- Corporate Networks - Probably a [[Multihomed AS]] - no [[Transit Traffic]] but possibly multiple providers.
- ISP - will also be an [[Autonomous System]] - [[Transit AS]] which carries [[Transit Traffic]]
