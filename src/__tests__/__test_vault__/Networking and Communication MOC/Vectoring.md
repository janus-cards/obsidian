### Summary ⌛:
Each router only exchanges information with its local neighbours. Each router only knows the next best hop to all other destinations in network. It does not have a complete picture of the network topology.

Path results are computed by composing the information of its neighbours best next hops. This information is usually passed with a data structure like a **Vector** hence the name.

### Problems:
[[Count to Infinity]]

### Examples
[[RIP]]
[[BGP]]
