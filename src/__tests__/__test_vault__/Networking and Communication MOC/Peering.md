### Summary ⌛:
Two [[Autonomous System]] agree to route packets between their respective customers. **They do not provide transit between peers***. This is fair if both provide an equally large address space to go through.


### Pros and Cons:
Usually in competition with each other, and agreement may end up being one sided, but peering does help reduce upstream transit costs and increase overall performance of end-to-end transit.
