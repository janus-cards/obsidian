### Summary ⌛:
**Locus of Admin Domain**
Defined as a [[Autonomous Routing Domain]] which has been assigned an AS Number.
Routers may be far apart and connect to other networks in a very complicated way, but from the AS perspective, it is just one blob and connects simply to other [[Autonomous Routing Domain]]

### ISP:
The [[Internet Service Provider]]s are examples of ASes. They compete with each other to acquire the largest aggregation of customers. In effect, **the more customers you have** the more money you make. Hence, there is tremendous amounts of competition between ISPs. 

Some principles that they follow when doing [[Policy-Based Routing]]:
- Try to get the packets off your system as quick as possible. **Don't route through for free**
