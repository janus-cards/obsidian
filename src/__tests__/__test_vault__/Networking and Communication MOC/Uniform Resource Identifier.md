> **Uniform**: Abstracts the mechanism for accessing the resource from the resource identification, hence supporting more modes (existing and new).
> **Resource**: A resource in the general sense as something (service, person, building etc) that can be identified
> **Identifier**: Something that can uniquely distinguish the resource from all other resources of interest

> [!Important]
> Formally, a **URI** is an **identifier** which satisfies a certain set of syntax rules.

> [!Important]
> A URI can be either a **name** ([[Uniform Resource Name]]) or a **location** ([[Uniform Resource Location]]). As an approximation, if the URI can be used to access a resource *over the web*, then it is a [[Uniform Resource Location]] otherwise it is a [[Uniform Resource Name]]
