Change occurs by using one of two actions:
- **Addition**
- **Subtraction**

Changes which fundamentally are additive correspond to **extensions** of the system. The origin remains but is somehow enhanced.

On the other hand, if there is subtraction which ultimately ends in **substitution** of part or all of the system, then the original is lost. 

Both of these statements suffer from paradoxes of gradual change like [[Thesius' Ship]].
