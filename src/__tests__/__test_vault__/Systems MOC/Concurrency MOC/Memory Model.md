> [!Important]
> Defines the rules and guarantees for how memory operations, such as read and writes, will be ordered and visible across different threads, as well as providing [[Data Consistency]]

#### Examples
- [[C++ Memory Model]]: The C++11 memory model provides a set of atomic operations and memory orderings that allow for fine-grained control over the visibility and ordering of memory operations.
- [[Java Memory Model]]: The Java memory model, on the other hand, focuses on ensuring proper synchronization through the use of synchronized blocks and volatile variables.
- [[Hardware Memory Model]]
