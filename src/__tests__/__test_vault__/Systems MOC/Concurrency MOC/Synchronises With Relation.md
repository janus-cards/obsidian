This relationship is typically defined by the [[Memory Model]]

[[Ways of Achieving Synchronises With Relation]]

### Technical Definition:
- Firstly, synchronises with is a **relation between operations at runtime**. In otherwords, we can relate the execution of operations `a sw b`.

### Checking if two operations are synchronised:
1. Identify the synchronization actions or primitives used between the operations.
2. Verify if the ordering constraints imposed by the synchronization actions ensure that operation `a` is ordered before operation `b`.
3. Confirm that the synchronization actions provide the necessary visibility guarantees for the data shared between the operations.
