The goal of process synchronization is to ensure that concurrent processes or threads operate in a coordinated manner, such that their execution sequence:

1) **Maintains the consistency of shared resources and data** ([[Data Consistency]])
2) Prevents race conditions, deadlocks, and other synchronization-related issues.
