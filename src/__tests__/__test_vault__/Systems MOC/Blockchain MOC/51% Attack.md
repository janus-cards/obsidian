### Summary ⌛:
This happens when a malicious group owns 51% of the [[Hash Power]] of the network.

But even with this attack, you can't create lots of new coins (just the [[Coinbase]] that already existed), you can't steal coins as you need the private key of the account to verify the transaction, so you can only do a [[Blockchain Double Spend]]

### Bitcoin
Some claim that it is not possible to do this on bitcoin (like a nation state covertly fabricating lots of chips) because it requires so much compute and the cost would only grant you 1 [[Double Spend]]. The double spend would become so apparent that they would get kicked from the network and would have gained nothing in the process (and incurred huge financial losses). Instead, the incentive structure makes it much more profitable to actually use that compute to just mine.
