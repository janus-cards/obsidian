### Summary ⌛:
Pool of unconfirmed transactions. It is transactions that want to be added, and that the miners are free to select the most profitable ones to add to the block they will mine.

Through [[Gossiping]], nodes are told of transactions and can add and share transactions from their mempool, unless they are doing [[Selfish Mining]]
