### Summary ⌛:
Settlement is when we can say that we actually own this asset, now and forever legally, until we pass ownership to someone else. [[Vitalik Buterin]] in [this article](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/05/09/on-settlement-finality/) talks about [[Settlement Finality]] and how it cannot happen 100% if the time.

When you make a transaction, there is a probability of whether it will get mined. Then once it is mined, there is a probability that the block will remain on the blockchain (as another longer blockchain may overtake the one you are on). After the block is a certain depth, it is considered almost 100 settled, but there are cased where we may need to revert the ledger (e.g. 2010 bitcoin attack).
