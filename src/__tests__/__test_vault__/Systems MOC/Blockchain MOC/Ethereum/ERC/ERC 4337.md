Layer 2 approach at the [[Transaction Layer]].
- Set of user operations that can talk to the [[Smart Contract]].
- Wrap around transactions
- Allows for [[Quantum Safe Overlay on Ethereum]]

## Quotes:
* Instead of EVM code just being used to implement the logic of applications, it would also be used to implement the verification logic (nonces, signatures…) of individual users’ wallets.
* Post-quantum safe signature algorithms (eg. Lamport, Winternitz)
* **Sufficient to make the execution layer quantum-safe:** if this proposal gets universally adopted, no further work on the execution layer needs to be done for quantum-safety. Users can individually upgrade their wallets to quantum-safe ones. Even the wrapper transaction is safe, as the miner can use a new freshly created and hence hash-protected EOA for each bundle transaction and not publish the transaction before it is added in a block.
