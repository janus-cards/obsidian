### Summary âŒ›:
**A collection of peering nodes that form a consensus, with no single entity being the owner** - in effect a **distributed consensus protocol**.

**Consensus on state of ledger**

To participate, must follow the rules, otherwise will be rejected.

### How is this achieved?
- **Proof of Work** - for security
- **Mining Rewards** - for incentives
- **Public Key Cryptography** - for integrity
- **Linked Data Structure** - for chronology / ordering / logging - **Ledger**
- **Peer to Peer** - to distribute ownership - permissionless to allow for emergence of network. If permissions are controlled, not really distributed.
