### Summary ⌛:
- Blocks on average every 10 minutes:
	- If short - latency plays a role and the closer miners are to the broadcasted request, the more time they can spend and the more they make (more money) - centralizes
	- If long - fewer transactions and takes longer 
- Miners are rewarded with a **coinbase** (not same as company) transactions AND transaction fees.
- Transactions added to each block
- After 6 blocks - transaction is considered confirmed
	- **Longest chain always wins** - rest discard **THIS IS THE CONSENSUS MECHANISM**
	- So probability that your discarded decreases exponentially
	- **Cascade Effect** - Changing earlier blocks has ripple effect on future ones, so can't really change the past.
- **Difficulty change every 2016 blocks** - moving average how how many transactions and power there is so as to get sweep spot of 10 minutes
- **Limited amount of BTC**
	- Rewards halved every 4 years.
