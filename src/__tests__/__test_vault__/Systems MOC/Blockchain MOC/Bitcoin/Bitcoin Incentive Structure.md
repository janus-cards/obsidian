### Summary ⌛:
There are two types of reward:
1) **Block Reward**
2) **Transaction Fee**

### Coinbase
Every **block** starts with a special **transaction**, the [[Coinbase]] transaction. This is money that is sent from the zero account to the miner. It includes the **block reward** and creates new bitcoins, adding to circulation. Since the maximum number of bitcoin supply is fixed, this reward halves every couple of years in a geometric series. Eventually, the incentives will come primarily from the transaction fee

### Transaction Fee
Recall the [[UTXO Model]]. There are input and output transactions. The difference is the **transaction fee** which is the tip for mining the block. It provides an incentive for the transaction to be added to the block and mined.
