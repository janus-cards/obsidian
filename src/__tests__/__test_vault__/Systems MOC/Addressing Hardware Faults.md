> Adding [[Redundancy]] to improve [[System Reliability]]

- Statistically unavoidable as certain features scale, hence countermeasures should also scale automatically ([[Elastic (Systems)]])
- Probability of failure requires all components of same class to fail which is reduced with redundancy.

## Examples
- [[Replica Set]]
	- [[RAID]]
