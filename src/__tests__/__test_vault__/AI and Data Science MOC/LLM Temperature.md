The [[SoftMax]] head of a [[Language Model]] can be **sharpened or flattened** by modifying the exponent coefficient. 

Lower temperature -> sharper distribution -> less creative and more predictable

Higher temperature -> flatter distribution -> more creativity and less predictability

The probabilities of one token being chosen over another decreases for probable tokens with higher temperatures.
