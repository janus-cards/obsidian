### Summary ⌛:
All learning is **supervised** - human assistance.
At bare minimum, it is supervised by the **loss function** saying what is good and bad. 

**Supervised** - input output pairs - **Teach by Example**
**Semi-Supervised**
**Unsupervised** 
[[Reinforcement Learning]] - **Teach by Experience** - world designing

But unsupervised has a tiny human assistance (through the selection of loss function) but that labour is very small.
