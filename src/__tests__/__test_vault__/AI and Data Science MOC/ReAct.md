> To consider reasoning processes (like [[Chain of Th]]) and acting at the same time

> [!IDEA]
> Interleave reasoning traces with actions

> [!Quote]
> LLMs to generate both reasoning traces and task-specific actions in an interleaved manner, allowing for greater synergy between the two: reasoning traces help the model induce, track, and update action plans as well as handle exceptions, while actions allow it to interface with and gather additional information from external sources such as knowledge bases or environment

> [!IDEA]
> In essence, we are considering [[Agent]] reasoning and acting across multiple time steps, with either the last action or the aggregation of all the previous actions returned as a response.
