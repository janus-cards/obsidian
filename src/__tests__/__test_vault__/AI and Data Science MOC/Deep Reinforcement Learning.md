### Extra Thoughts 🧠:

### Summary ⌛:
Learning to solve sequential decision making problems by **trial and error** 

[[Types of Learning]]

[[Reinforcement Learning]]

[[Agents and Environments]]

Setup is always same. We have a an input output black box and by figuring out what is **good or bad** we can change the inner working of the box. Obviously debate about how we choose good vs bad.

### Pipeline:
At heart, its about agents interacting with the environment.

Steps:
- **Sense** environment (through sensors of some form)
- **Represent** and Perceive environment (attend to senses and extract important features)
- **Reason** about knowledge
- **Plan**
- **Act** (using an effector)

Learning is about changing the behaviour of the inner steps by being rewarded or punished.

### Some examples:
- [[Deep Q-Networks]]
- [[Policy Gradient]]
- [[Advantage Actor-Critic]]
- [[Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient]]
- [[TPRO]]
- [[AlphaZero]]
