# Definition
> "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E." - **Tom Mitchell**

# Black Box
Machine learning attempts to approximate some functional system, some black box. It does this by optmizing the performance (and hence the similiarity to the functional system) using examples (*more precisely, this is supervised machine learning as the function must have input/output pairs to learn*)
