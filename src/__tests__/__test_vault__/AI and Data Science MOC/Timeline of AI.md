1. **[[Birth of AI]] (1950s - 1960s)**: The term [[Artificial Intelligence]] was coined by [[John McCarthy]] in 1956 at the [[Dartmouth Conference]]. This period was characterized by significant optimism about the potential of AI, leading to substantial investment and research.

2. **First AI Winter (1970s)**: Despite early enthusiasm, progress in AI did not meet the high expectations set in the 50s and 60s. Funding was cut significantly, leading to a period of reduced activity and pessimism in AI research known as the "AI winter."

3. **Brief Revival (1980s)**: The development of [[Expert Systems]], which are computer systems that emulate the decision-making ability of a human expert, led to renewed interest and investment in AI. There was significant commercial success and funding (from #japan) throughout this period.

4. **Second AI Winter (Late 1980s - 1990s)**: The market for AI collapsed in the late 1980s due to the limitations of expert systems and the high cost of AI implementation, leading to another period of reduced funding and interest known as the "second AI winter."

[[What ended the second AI Winter]]
1. **AI Spring (2000s - Present)**:
   - **Emergence of Machine Learning (Early 2000s)**: The development of machine learning algorithms, which allow computers to learn from and make decisions based on data, led to significant progress in AI research and applications.
   - **Deep Learning Revolution (Mid-2000s - Present)**: Deep learning, a subset of machine learning that structures algorithms in layers to create an "artificial neural network" that can learn and make intelligent decisions on its own, has led to significant advancements in AI capabilities. This period has seen AI successes in areas like image and speech recognition, and even beating humans at complex games like Go.
