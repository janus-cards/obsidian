## Overview
A story about sparrows trying to capture and nurture a much more powerful creature but in its infancy (the Owl). However, some sparrows oppose this because not enough thought has been given into the taming of this superior power.

It is an #allegory for humans pursuit of [[Superintelligence]]
## Thoughts
- Illustrates the [[Folly]] of not considering safety and how such a power will be tamed. Goes hand in hand with [[AI Safety]]
- There is a [[Presupposition]] that such a power can be tamed by something less powerful. However, taming is used in the context of animals by humans, so the power dynamics are reversed. 
	- Alternative phrasing instead of taming could be guiding and nurturing like a parent to a child for [[Upward Mobility]]
