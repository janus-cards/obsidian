> A common strategy for proving [[Optimal Substructure Property]] or [[Greedy Choice Property]] is to:
> - Assume we have solution that does not have this property
> - Consider some transformation of this solution that further improves it.
> - Hence, this shows the original solution was not optimal
> - By contradiction, the optimal solution must have the desired property
