### Summary ⌛:
A sequence on each dimension with a row and col for empty. If you call the first sequence the rows and second sequence the columns, then going down means we read another letter from first (and hence should delete to match) and going right means we read another letter from second (and hence should insert to match)

F(i,j) means we have just read the ith of seq 1 and the jth of seq 2
