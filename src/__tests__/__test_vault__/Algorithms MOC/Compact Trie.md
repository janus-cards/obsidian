### Summary ⌛:
A space-efficient trie that somehow compacts the edges.
There are many variations:

- **Canonical** - A [[Trie]] where non-branching paths are compressed (like in a [[Suffix Tree]]). This reduces the total number of nodes and hence data.
- [[Radix Trie]] to some extent
- [[Patricia Trie]]
