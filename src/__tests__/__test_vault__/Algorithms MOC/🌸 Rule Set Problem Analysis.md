> A rule set problem is one where some data type, typically a string or bit-string, can be transformed using a sequence of operations with pre and post conditions.


## Techniques
- [[Reversibility Property]] - Is the sequence of operations symmetric? Then going from an input to the same target may be transformed into a problem from going from the same starting point and going to the input
