### Summary ⌛:
Measures how dissimilar to strings are.

Can be computed by performing a global alignment with an appropriate scoring matrix, **namely mismatch and indels = -1 and match = 0**
### Variety:
- **Levenshtein Distance** - number of insertions, deletions or substitutions needed to make one string into the other.
- **Hamming Distance** - number of susbsitutions. Hence, it counts +1 if characters are different.
- [[Longest Common Subsequence]] length - number of insertions and deletions needed to make one string into the other.
