[[OAuth Roles]]
![[Pasted image 20241001130829.png]]
- Client requests access to a resource by asking the resource owner
- The resource owner grants approval (if they want). This grant may be generated by the Authorization server on behalf of the resource owner, requiring the resource owner to first be authenticated
- The client then goes to the Authorization server with the grant, and after being authenticated by the server, is issued with an [[OAuth Access Token]]
- The client can then go to the resource serve with the token and if it is verified, will receive access to the requested resource.
