### Summary ⌛:
Reverse mapping of hashes to passwords. Hashes of popular / common hashes, and hence can find original password from the hash.

Use [[Salting]] (a different salt for each user) to prevent using a rainbow table for all users at once. (have to make one for each user and becomes very inefficient).
