### Summary ⌛:
Security is the discipline that examines how certain [[Security Goals]] can be achieved through constraining the [[Action Space]] of [[Actors]].

[[Regulation on Human Behaviour]] provides actions of human actors which are similiar to the categories that constrain a digital actor.

### Methods:
- [[Trust as an assumption on the adversary action space]]
- [[Cryptography]]
- [[Economics]] - This was the interesting perspective that blockchain introduced. Essentially the [[Cost Benefit Analysis]] of actions disincentives bad actors, and even if they are willing to take a loss, the barriers may be too high.
