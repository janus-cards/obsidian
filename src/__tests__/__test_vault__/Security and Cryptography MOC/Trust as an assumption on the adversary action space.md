### In Abstract Modelling
If we trust someone, we **assume that the action space that agent can perform is reduced, usually those activities which are considered malicious or atypical**.

This restriction of the [[Action Space]] may be enforced through the use of secrets and cryptographic primitives. Those who are trusted have access to the keys and those who don't do not.
