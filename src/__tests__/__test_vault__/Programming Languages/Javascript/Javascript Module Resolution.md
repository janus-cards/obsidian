- Module Resolution in Browsers:
	- A module imports another with a relative import
	- Take the URL of that module:
		- If its imported in a script element in an html component than the url is the base url of the html file received
		- If it is a fetched module than its URL is whatever was used to fetch it
	- Then treat the module specifier relative to that URL to construct the final URL that you call.
