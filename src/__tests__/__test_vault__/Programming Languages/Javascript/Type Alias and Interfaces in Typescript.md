- Type Alias vs Interfaces in Typescript:
	- **Type Alias**
		- Extended through Intersection notation
		- Can only be declared once
		- Can be used to specific non-object types, like union of literals
	- **Interface**
		- Extended through `extends` notations
		- Declaring it again will add the new properties to the existing declaration. This is called **declaration merging**
		- Focused only on specifying the shape of an object type
