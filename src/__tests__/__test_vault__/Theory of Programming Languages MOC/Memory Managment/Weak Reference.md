**A reference that does not protect an object from being garbage collected**. This is therefore a concern of garbage collected languages, although variations exist in non-garbage-collected languages like C++ ([[Weak Pointer]]). In most cases, this means that the weak reference does not contribute to reference counting.

There exist a [[Taxonomy of reference weakness levels]]
