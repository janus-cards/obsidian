### Summary ⌛:
(Parametric) Polymorphism can be achieved by extending function application and abstraction to types as well. The lambda term therefore represents a generic that when instantiated will be substituted / replaced.

Check out [[System F]] for typing rules.

Note the [[Curry Howard Lambek Correspondence]] for polymorphism is universal quantification and instantiation.
