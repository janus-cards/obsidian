One of three main forms of [[Polymorphism]].

**Multiple implementations may be defined under the same name, with the most suitable implementation being selected in a given context (best with respect to the types)**

This typically is synonymous with [[Function Overloading]]

**Early** [[Binding]] compared to **Late Binding** of [[Subtype Polymorphism]]
