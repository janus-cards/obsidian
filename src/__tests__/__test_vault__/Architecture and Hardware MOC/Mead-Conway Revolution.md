- Key to [[Separation of Chip Design from Fabrication]]
	- [[ðŸŒ¸ Specialization of Process]] allowed for faster improvements that compounded because of [[ðŸŒ¸ Passing Enabling Thresholds on Scales]]
	- Rise of purely fabless firms like [[Nvidia]] and [[Qualcomm]], which allowed them to focus on new forms of computing.
		- Possible in part because [[Division of Labour]] can reduce overheads.
- Educational Influence
	- Sped up education of [[VLSI]] and chip design in university thanks to an influential book that came out
- Government ([[DARPA]]) backed.
