## Physical Limits
Computation exists as the evolution of a system. That system often resides in a larger system, such as hardware within the natural system of the universe. The [[Code as a vocabulary for computation]] is restricted by the rules governing the parent system. 

There are opportunities though as observing the existence of new laws in nature allow for new computation systems to be designed ([[Quantum Computing as harnessing quantum mechanics]]).


## Classical Theory Limits
