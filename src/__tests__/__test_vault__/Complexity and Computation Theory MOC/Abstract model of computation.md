## Desire
Considering the interpretation of [[Computation as evolution over time]] of a system, one must define:
1. **Time**
2. **State**
3. **Action**
Finally, 4. an acknowledgement of how **time is to be exchanged for action/work**.

However, things are not so straight forward because of [[ðŸŒ¸ The Duality of State and Action]]. This usually entails that the state can be reinterpretation as action.

Put slightly differently by wikipedia:
> [!QUOTE]
> In its most abstract form, a computation machine must have:
> 1.  Operations for processing [primitive data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_data_type "Primitive data type"):
> 2.  Operations and data structures for controlling the sequence of [execution of operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_(computing) "Execution (computing)");
> 3.  Operations and data structures for controlling [data transfers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_communication "Data communication");
> 4.  Operations and data structures for [memory management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management "Memory management").
