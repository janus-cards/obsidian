### Summary ⌛:
**A system is logically consistent if a faslehood cannot be derived.**

In the Simply Typed Lambda Calculus, a corollary of the [[Fundamental Lemma]] is that **no such term of empty type exists**, as this would mean that the term is in $Halts_0$ which is impossible. Hence the Simply Typed Lambda Calculus, by [[Curry Howard Lambek Correspondence]], is logically consistent, as there exists no proof of falsehood.
