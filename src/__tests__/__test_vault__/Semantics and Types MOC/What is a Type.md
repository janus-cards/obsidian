There are three points of view:
1) [[Denotational Semantics]] - A type is a **set of values**. An object is of a type if it is in the set.
2) **Structural** / [[Constructivism]] - A type is either a **primitive** type or is something constructed by applying a **constructor** to some other objects.
3) **Interface** / [[Abstraction]] - A type defines a set of actions that can be performed over it.
