An [[Execution Context]] provides all the resources and information to evaluate a piece of code. This is approximately the [[Store (Semantics)]]/Memory and [[Environment (Semantics)]]


- When a function is executed, variables go in and out of [[Scope (Programming)]]. These means a big change to the [[Environment (Semantics)]], and this is usually controlled by adding some information onto the stack. We usually say the context has been changed.
