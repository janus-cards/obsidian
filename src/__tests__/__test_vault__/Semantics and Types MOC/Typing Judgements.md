### Summary ⌛:
Here are some of the judgements we are interested in:
1) T type - **Is the type well formed**
2) $\Gamma ctx$ - **Is the types of the variable context well formed**
3) $x:T$ - **Does the term x have type T**

### Well Formed Types
We need to make sure that if a type has variables in it, then those variables are accounted for in the context.
