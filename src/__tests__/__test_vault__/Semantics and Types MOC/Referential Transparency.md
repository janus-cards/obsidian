> An [expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(programming) "Expression (programming)") is called _referentially transparent_ if it can be [replaced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rewriting "Rewriting") with its corresponding value (and vice-versa) without changing the program's behavior

This requires the expression to be pure with no side effects.
