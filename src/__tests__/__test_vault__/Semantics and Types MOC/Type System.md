### Summary ⌛:
A [[Type]] is simply a **set of value**, all of a similar concept. Having a type system has the following benefits:
- It allows us to split expressible programs into those that make sense (**are typable**) and those that don't.
- Helps the compiler figure out representation of data / memory etc.
